gomock for Bazel
================

This skylark code allows you to generate code with `mockgen` (from
[`golang/mock`](https://github.com/golang/mock)) and use that code as a dependency in
your bazel projects. It handles all the `GOPATH` stuff for you.

`bazel_gomock` requires a `rules_go` external to be set up in your `WORKSPACE`
as well as a go_repository setup for `com_github_golang_mock` (unless you
override an argument; see below).

You call it in your BUILD files as

```python
gomock(
    name = "mock_sess",
    out = "mock_sess_test.go",
    interfaces = ["SessionsClient"],
    library = "//proto/sessions/sessproto:go_default_library",
    package = "main",
)
```

where `library` is a `go_library` target, `interfaces` is the list of names of
the Go interfaces you'd like `mockgen` to generate mocks of, `package` is the
name of the Go package at the top of the generated file (in this example,
`package "main"`), and `out` is the path of generated source file that will be
made.

There is also a `source` parameter described below.

You use this target's `out` file directly in the `srcs` parameter in `go_test`,
`go_library`, and so on. So, when the above example `gomock` call is used in the
same BUILD file, you put `mock_sess_test.go` in the `srcs` parameter like so:


```python
go_test(
    name = "go_default_test",
    srcs = [
         "cool_test.go",
         "mock_sess_test.go",
    ],
    embed = [":go_default_library"]
    ...
)
```

If you need to generate mocks from a specific Go file instead of a
import path (say, because the `go_library` you have is a `main` package and is
therefore unreflectable by Go tools and specifically unimportable by `mockgen`),
add the `source` parameter with the location of source file. E.g. `source =
"//fancy/path:foo.go"` or just `source = "foo.go"` if the file is in the same
directory). The `library` parameter must still be set to the library that source
file lives in so that any referenced dependencies can be pulled into the Go
path.

Also, `gazelle` will remove the generated source file from a `go_test` target's
`srcs` unless you end the generated file name with `_test.go`.

As a likely unused feature, you can pass in an alternative
external for where to find the `mockgen` tool target using the `mockgen_tool`
parameter. The only rule for the target is that must be a binary. The current
default is `"@com_github_golang_mock//mockgen"`.

If you try to use `gomock` on a `go_library` that is in the package `main` (and so
probably being immediately used as an `embed` target for a `go_binary`), you'll
get an annoying error like:

```
prog.go:13:2: import "your/main/package/deal" is a program, not an importable package
```

You can resolve that by setting the `source` parameter to the location of the
file with the interfaces you want in it.

## `gomock` arguments:

| Name | Default value | Type | Documentation |
|------|---------------|------|---------------|
| name | | string | The name of the target. (Required.) |
| library| | Label | The go_library to find the interfaces in. (Required.) |
| interfaces | | list of string | The names of interfaces in `library` to generate mocks for. (Required if `source` is not set, and ignored if `source` is set.) |
| source | | string | Prefer using `library` only, instead of using this argument. The Go source file to generate interfaces from. If this is set, `interfaces` is ignored because `mockgen` will always generate code for all interfaces. See the gomock documentation on `-source` for more information. |
| out | | string | The file name to give the generated output. (Required.) |
| package | | string | The package name to use in the generated output. See the gomock documentation on `-package` for more information. |
| imports | | string\_dict | Dictionary of keys of package names and values of import paths to use the keys as the identifier to use when the generated output uses the given import path. See the gomock documentation on `-imports` for more information. |
| self\_package | |  string | The full import path for the generated code. See the gomock documentation on `-self_package` for more information. |
| mock\_names | | string\_dict | Dictionary of interface name to mock name pairs to change the output names of the mock objects. Mock names default to 'Mock' prepended to the name of the interface. See the gomock documentation on `-mock_names` for more information. |
| copyright\_file | | Label | The file containing the copyright to prepend to the generated output. See the gomock documentation on `-copyright_file` for more information. |
| aux\_files | | string\_list\_dict | A map from packages to auxilliary Go source files to load for those packages. Currently, assumes that the file (the value) is a path relative to the directory of `library` in the GOPATH. See the gomock documentation on `-aux_files` for more information. |
